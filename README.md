# Emotion_Recognition
The Kaggle Emotion and Facial Expression Recognition challenge training dataset consists of 28,709 images, each of which are 48 Ã— 48 grayscale images (Figure 10.1).
The faces have been automatically aligned such that they are approximately the same size in each image. 
Given these images, our goal is to categorize the emotion expressed on each face into seven distinct classes: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral.
